## Goals
#### [RFC 8259](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259)-compliance (or as close to it as possible, while remaining practical).
#### High performance and reliability, by 
1. eliminating efficiency problems by using modern C++ design practices.
2. not using any third-party libraries.
3. minimizing future debugging difficulties by keeping the code concise and readable.

#### This repository is being developed alongside (and integrated with) a glTF loader-writer library.
